ComposerAi

A Java implementation of an AI to compose music based on a given seed. Originally a conceptual idea that I contemplated how to do for months. I started work using the idea as the basis of a project.

Currently, it is very unfinished and can only generate a sequence of chords. The progressions generated are very limited and standard.
